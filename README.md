# le9 Unofficial

Working set protection that is compatible with both the traditional LRU and the Multi-Gen LRU (a.k.a. lru_gen)

## How it works

## Demo

https://youtu.be/z12b4e-vSVw

le9uo's positive effect is so obvious to see by running the following 3 continuous workers at the same time:
- `$ while true; do tail /dev/zero; done` to impose continuous memory stress
- `$ cat /path/to/some_huge_file > /dev/null` to fill and rotate file cache LRU
- `$ while true; do time cat /path/to/some_moderately_large_file > /dev/null; sleep $(($(cat /sys/kernel/mm/lru_gen/min_ttl_ms)/1000+1)); done` to measure file access time

Results:

In this specific test case, it shows approximately +3700% improvement in file access performance.

## Tunables

### Example
`$ sudo sysctl -w vm.workingset_protection=1`

### workingset_protection (range: 0 - 1, default: 0)

1 Enables le9uo.  
0 Disables le9uo.

### anon_min_ratio (range: 0 - 100, default: 15)

How much in percentile of total physical memory to preserve for HARD protection of anonymous pages.

### clean_min_ratio (range: 0 - 100, default: 15)

How much in percentile of total physical memory to preserve for HARD protection of clean file pages.

### clean_low_ratio (range: 0 - 100, default: 0)

How much in percentile of total physical memory to preserve for SOFT protection of clean file pages.
